# SGL
SGL (Simple Gui Libary) with is maded in glad and opengl
**its main focus is to be simple, with includes events, widgets, and 'boxes' (or if you want call it, containers)**
**boxes is like semi/distant part of the main window**, like on a painting software you have the main scene, the tools and the menus
it may allow transisions, to anything complex like painting software, this is for you

if you want make **games**, **this not for you, unless is a simple game or teaching others SGL, i don't recomend SGL, it will be pain depending on your comfort**
**SGL focus on everyday software like painting software, code editors, desktop programs, etc**
**perfomace is not main concer here**, of cource users don't want wait 5 hours to a program, but all(most) programs will be you optimizing
we not optimizing your sh\*tty code, no one asked to make bloated, try optimize it
it will be currently **only c++**, but you can integreate on python, etc depending on programming language
finally, since is easy to configure, its kinda fast to make projects, of cource depends on your **experience**

**conclusion**: until version 1.0.0  don't use it as it still not complete, unless you want fix bugs or contribuite, you shouln't use it
